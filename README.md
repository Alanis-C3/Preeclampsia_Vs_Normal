# Preeclampsia_Vs_Normal
## CGS4144 project assignment

### Data
The dataset is called Transcriptome profiling of deciduas from pre-eclamptic and normotensive pregnancies and is RNA data collected from Illumina HumanWG-6 v3.0 expression beadchip. The data selected comes from The University of Western Australia from a study titled Genome-wide transcriptome directed pathway analysis of maternal pre-eclampsia susceptibility genes. A background to this is that there have been previous studies to show a genetic cause preeclampsia. In the study they focus on finding a susceptibility gene, and how a change in this gene leads to downstream effects in the body during pregancy resulting the development of preeclampsia. The main focus was the see what processes and pathways were affected by the susceptibility gene and how those pathways played a role in producing a normal pregancy. 

### Question
The scientific question I aim to answer is: *What is the significance of susceptibility genes in the development of preeclampsia, and can their early identification predict the condition before symptoms appear?*
